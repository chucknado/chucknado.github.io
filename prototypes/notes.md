## Potential dev portal plan


### Short term 

* Pick low-hanging fruit

* Add "Get Started" link to the page topbar, replacing "Events" to make space (the existing Events link is pretty much useless for devs as it now links to the company's events page)

	BONUS: The topbar appears on every page on the site.

* Add big "Get Started" tile on home page -> see [mockup](#).

	Link to a Get started guide in [Develop](https://help.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/categories/203996887-Develop) on the company HC (https://help.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/sections/206226987).
	
	Repurpose the content in the [Total beginners guide to the Zendesk platform](https://help.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/sections/206226987-Total-beginners-guide-to-the-Zendesk-platform).

* Add links in content in Develop HC to get back to ref docs for users directed to 
GS content


### Medium term

* 1 to 2 months

* Spin up a Developer HC with its own customized home page, and move GS, guides, updates, and dev communities to it - see Support HC at https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us for an example
	- get HC features (voting, subscriptions, comments, etc)
	- get integrated communities
	- get a better place for announcements and change notifications (see Support hc home page)
	- content design flexibility and agility
	- control branding to closely match developer.zendesk.com for better user experience
	- use our own content publishing product


* Move dev communities to new HC


### Long term

* 6-12 months

* Reskin/restructure Hercules with a cross-product, cross-area landing page
