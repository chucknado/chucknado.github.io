## Proposed roadmap


### Short term (low-hanging fruit)

* 2 to 4 weeks

* Change "Events" link on page top bar to "Get Started":

	BONUS: The top bar appears on every page on the site.

	My guess is the existing Events link is pretty low-benefit for developers because it links to the company's events page (https://www.zendesk.com/company/events).


* Add big "Get Started" tile to home page:

* Make both links point to a Get started guide in the company HC (https://help.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/sections/115002917448).

	The new GS section would repurpose the content in the [Total beginners guide to the Zendesk platform](https://help.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/sections/206226987-Total-beginners-guide-to-the-Zendesk-platform).

* Add more cross references in [learning content](https://help.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/categories/203996887-Develop) to [reference content](https://developer.zendesk.com), and vice versa 


### Medium term

* 1 to 3 months

* Spin up a dedicated developer HC with its own customized home page:

	<img src="https://zen-marketing-documentation.s3.amazonaws.com/docs/en/comp-05.png" width="600">

	Better user experience and substantially more design flexibility than the current [HC category](https://help.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/categories/203996887-Develop).

* Move  developer communities (currently on the [Support HC](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us)) and learning content (currently on the [company HC](https://help.zendesk.com/hc/en-us)) to the dedicated developer Help Center

* Surface platform updates and change notices on the home page (see left column in mockup above)

* Benefits:

	- get all HC features (voting, subscriptions, comments, etc)
	- get integrated communities
	- get a better place for announcements and change notifications
	- design flexibility and agility
	- control branding to closely match developer.zendesk.com for better user experience
	- use our own web publishing product


### Long term

* 6-12 months

* Restructure Hercules front end to add:
	 - an explore/learn track
	 - a cross-product layer 

* Example - Click the following link to use rough working example: http://chucknado.github.io/prototypes/developer-zendesk-com/

	<a href="http://chucknado.github.io/prototypes/developer-zendesk-com/" target="_blank"><img src="https://zen-marketing-documentation.s3.amazonaws.com/docs/en/comp-06.png" width="500"></a>

* Each focus area and each product would have it's own landing page with a customized menu of learning and reference content. For examples, click the focus area and product links in the mockup above.
